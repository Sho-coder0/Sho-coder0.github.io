      <h2>Aims of this project</h2>
      <p>This project aims to explore the associations between growth components and fiscal balances rather than establish causal relationships in OECD countries by visualising several datasets. The analysis involves several key indicators, such as GDP scales, GDP growth contributions, fiscal balances, and population outlook. Specifically, it focuses on how capital accumulation, labour input (hourly work), and multi-factor productivity (MFP) contribute to overall GDP growth in OECD countries, and how these contributions relate to public fiscal balance across different periods and countries. </p>
      <p>These objectives are interactive and analytical by combining interactive time-series charts and cross-country rankings. As a result, the project allows users to identify structural differences in growth patterns in OECD countries over time. Furthermore, users can also gain policy indications about improving the fiscal situation in terms of economic growth.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the linear regression supports users in examining this relationship. Through a single linear and a multilinear regression model, this project provides a quantitative complement to the visual analysis.</p>

      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>This project primarily utilises the OECD downloaded as CSV files and World Bank data imported through the API. Specifically, GDP levels, growth contributions, including capital, labour input and MFP, and fiscal balances were obtained from the OECD Data Explorer. Population projections were automatically obtained from the World Bank Database using its API.</p>
      <p>The data is cleaned and merged using Python, including reshaping the raw data into datasets, standardising column names, and constructing derived variables such as total GDP growth (the sum of component contributions). Generative AI was utilised to modify the coding, while I specified analytical methods and interpreted the results. All data procedures are scripted in Google Colab notebooks or automated through the API, ensuring reproducibility and ease of future updates.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the limitation of data ranges has to be admitted. In this project, a worldwide-level analysis was ideal because it allowed for the secure collection of numerous samples across countries. However, since the World Bank, the most likely data provider, does not provide the capital growth rate data, capital growth had to be calculated separately. Therefore, I found that the analysis in OECD members was appropriate for this project to ensure consistency of analysis.</p>

      <h2>Challenges and Tools in data cleaning and analysis</h2>
      <p>Several challenges arose during data cleaning and visualisation. First, country coverage and time ranges were inconsistent across datasets, requiring careful filtering to avoid misleading comparisons. For example, hours worked and MFP for Korea are only available from 2012 onwards in OECD Data Explorer. To address this, the data was grouped by country and year, and the number of available contribution components was counted. Total GDP growth was calculated only when all three components, Capital, Hours, and MFP, were present; otherwise, values were recorded as missing. Second, OECD Data Explorer could not call the API as a JSON file. Therefore, the data was downloaded as CSV files and processed using Python.</p>
      <p>In addition, the single linear regression between fiscal balances Year-over-Year and GDP growth yielded a relatively low R-squared of 0.32, indicating that the model can only explain 32% of the result. Therefore, the model was extended to a multilinear regression that included capital, labour, and MFP. Consequently, the multilinear regression could improve the R-squared from 0.32 to 0.42, although other omitted variable biases, for example, the fiscal policy stance of governments and differences in tax and inflation rates across countries, should still be considered.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>In conclusion, this project revealed that GDP growth is potentially associated with a positive fiscal balance through interactive visualisations over time in OECD countries. Charts 1 - 4 supported various GDP growth trends and fiscal situations across countries, visualised as a map, decomposition time series data and a heat map. Ultimately, charts 5 - 6 and the table compensated for analytical consistency, integrating the trends.</p>
      <p>The most significant finding in this project is that labour growth and MFP are the key drivers in improving fiscal balances. This project indicates that some OECD countries could improve their fiscal situation with a rising population, although other countries, such as Japan, Italy, and Spain, will suffer decreasing population trends in Chart 7. However, this project supports another positive possibility: if such countries with a declining population can enhance MFP, they could also improve their fiscal sustainability.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this project can be advanced. First, the model does not imply causality, and omitted institutional factors, such as governments’ fiscal stance, may bias the estimates. Additionally, using year-over-year changes in fiscal balances may understate the long-term effects of capital accumulation. Addressing these issues would improve the robustness of the results.</p>
